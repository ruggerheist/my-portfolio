# Rick Heist's Project Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I created a portfolio to hold my most important projects related to my coding development. Included are links to 4 projects, a link to my GitHub, and a button to send me an email. A media query was also used to make this page mobile friendly. 

Everything for this was written from scratch. It helped better my understanding of HTML and how my choices within the index effect what can be done with the stylesheet. Using flexbox was a big hurdle for this project that I was able to sort out with some help from classmates and instructors.
